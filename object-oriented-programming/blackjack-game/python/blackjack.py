        This is a simplified version of the game of blackjack.            

        The game is played with a standard deck of cards. Picture cards
        have a value of 10. Aces can have the value of 1 or 11. 

        At the start of each game, you will be dealt 2 cards. So will
        the dealer. You will be able to see your cards, but one of the
        dealer's cards is hidden.

        If your hand has an initial value of 21 you immediately score BlackJack
        and win the game. Otherwise, you must decide whether you wish to "Stick"
        or "Twist" (get another card). Your turn continues until you decide to
        stick, or the value of your hand exceeds 21 - in which case you are "bust".

        The dealer will then play. A card will be automatically dealt to them
        every 2 seconds until the value of their hand is 17 or higher. You don't
        need to do anything other than watch. At this stage they will either be
        "bust" (hand value over 21) or the game will be won by whoever has the
        highest value hand.
        
        Each game results in a 2-point win for either you or the dealer.
        There are no draws.

        The match continues until one of you scores 20 points.
