## Issues

If you find a mistake, bug, or other problem, please [open an issue](https://github.com/raspberrypilearning/ada-code-samples/issues) in this repository.

## Pull requests

All edits to a resource should be made to the draft branch or to a fork of the repo. These patches can then be submitted as a pull request.

If you fix a mistake, bug, or problem or have something to contribute, please create a pull request for each modification. Please consider grouping modifications sensibly, e.g. don't bundle typo fixes in the same pull request as code changes, file them separately instead.
